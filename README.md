# Geotag

I want to make a simple webserver where users can post comments about coordinates they are at.  For instance, a site where a user can post where post office boxes can be found around the neighborhood, or bathrooms on a college campus.  Keeping in mind that some users may be more trustworthy than others, users should have the option to blacklist other users' locations from their maps, or only allow whitelisted users' posts to show.

This involves setting up a web server, a database that can manage different users and posts, a cookie system that allows a user to stay logged in without compromising the site's security, and maybe even an API that would allow more convenient use of the platform (e.g. an app, so getting locations for geotagging is easy).  Users and Tags (Posts?) are two important objects (components?) in the system.  What relationships must be considered in the data design of the system?
